<h1>The best Movies according to Didrik</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Gladiator</h3>

<p>
This is easily the nr. 1 on this list. I have seen this more than 30+ times and it never ceases to entertain me (are you not entertained?!). In this film we meet the roman general Maximus played by Russel Crowe, on what ends up being a revenge quest to avenge the undoings done against him and his family. Entangled in more than just his one personal quest, Maximus becomes a part of a larger conspiracy againgst the newly annointed emperor Commodus. This film offers plenty of intrigue, and it all culminates at the greatest stage of them all. The legendary Colosseo.<br />
Directed by Ridley Scott.

<h3>The Rock</h3>
<p>
Alcatraz has been the subject of many stories and film, but this is the best one. In my eyes, it's the perfect 90's actionfilm. It has over the top action sequences, ridiculus driving by the local law enforcement, insane Nicholas Cage emotes and much more. It is a film with masculinity put quite in the center of everything and it will take your breath away until the end.<br /> Stanley Goodspeed, played by Nicholas Cage, has to work together with ex-inmate and escapee of the Alcatraz prison (Sean Connery) to infiltrate a hostage situation on the island. With ex-military forces threatening the lives of visiting tourists of the ex-prison and the whole city of San Francisco with some kind of lethal gas, it is paramount that Goodspeed manages to stop them in time. <br /> Directed by Michael Bay

<h3>Superbad</h3>
<p>
This is the newest entry of my "top films of all time" lists, but I just have to put it in here. I finally managed to watch the whole film and it did not disappoint. You just gotta get through "The funny thing about my back is that it's on dick" - quote. Just push through this excrutiating moment in the film and you'll be golden. I watched it twice in 3(?) days and it was almost better on the second watch. Definitely a movie I will watch many times in my lifetime.<br /> This is a story of two High School students whom are not exactly part of the cool guys-crew. Seth and Evan with their friend Fogel, goes on an insane journey to deliver alcohol to the first party they've ever been invited to. This is a one crazy night-movie and contains important messages about friendship as well as a ton of (somewhat inappropriate) jokes.<br />Directed by Greg Mottola (produced by Seth Rogen, Judd Apatow and more)
